            <h2>Understanding Overtime Eligibility in 2026</h2>
            <p>Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), most employees who work more than 40 hours per week are entitled to overtime pay at one and a half times their regular rate. However, certain employees classified as "exempt" may not be eligible for overtime. Exemption status depends on salary level, job duties, and applicable state laws.</p>

            <h3>The FLSA Salary Threshold</h3>
            <p>The federal salary threshold determines the minimum salary level below which most salaried employees must receive overtime pay regardless of their job duties. For 2026, this threshold is projected based on Department of Labor rulemaking. Some states have set higher thresholds than the federal level.</p>

            <h3>Duties Test</h3>
            <p>Even if an employee meets the salary threshold, they must also meet specific duties tests to be classified as exempt. These tests evaluate whether the employee's primary duties involve executive, administrative, professional, computer, or outside sales functions as defined by the FLSA.</p>

            <h3>State-Specific Rules</h3>
            <p>Several states have overtime rules that go beyond federal requirements. Some states require daily overtime (after 8 hours in a day), have higher salary thresholds, or apply different rules to specific industries. This checker considers key state variations for informational purposes.</p>
